    <h1>Thanos</h1>
      <p><strong>Thanos was a warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping out half of all life at every level no matter what it took him and what the cost where, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish.</strong></p>
